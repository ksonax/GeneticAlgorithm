# Genetic Algorithm For Beale Function
Evolutionary Computing - Cracow University Of Technology - Project

## Install required libraries:

pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt

## Description

* Aplication alows user to find minimum and maximum values in Beale Function using genetic algorithm.

* User can input parameters, and configure selection, cross and mutation methods.

* Application returns:
  *  Execution time.
  *  Best value found by the algorithm.

* It also creates plots, and saves data for:
  * Best values in generations.
  * Average values in generations.
  * Standard deviation in generations.
